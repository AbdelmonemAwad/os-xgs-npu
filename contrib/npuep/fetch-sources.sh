#
# Why this exists at all. An out-of-tree kernel module is compiled against headers, and the
# headers have to be the ones the running kernel was built from. OPNsense does not ship kernel
# sources and there is no package that provides them, so for a long time this appliance simply
# had a 333MB /usr/src/sys that somebody had copied there once - no version recorded, no
# provenance, not a package and not a checkout. It built, so nobody asked.
#
# It was the wrong tree. It was stock FreeBSD 15.1-RELEASE, BRANCH="RELEASE", while the kernel
# is OPNsense's own build of 15.1-RELEASE-p1 from github.com/opnsense/src. The trees differ in
# 156 files. That the module worked anyway was luck, and it was only confirmed as luck by
# fetching the right tree and rebuilding: __FreeBSD_version is 1501000 in both, none of the 156
# files is in a path this driver includes, and the two builds came out BYTE-IDENTICAL. Good
# news, and not a reason to keep guessing - the next kernel is not obliged to be so kind.
#
# The kernel names its own commit. `uname -v` on this board reads
#
#	FreeBSD 15.1-RELEASE-p1 stable/26.7-n283674-12334a596709 SMP
#
# and the last field of that middle token is the git commit in opnsense/src. So the sources can
# always be pinned to exactly what is running, with no version file to keep up to date.
#
# ORDER MATTERS AFTER AN UPDATE, and on an appliance whose WAN is one of the coprocessor's own
# ports it matters more than it looks.
#
# `uname -v` reports the RUNNING kernel. Pin to it after the reboot and the sources are right;
# pin to it before, and they are the old ones, perfectly and uselessly.
#
# But on this appliance the obvious order - update, reboot, fetch, build - has a circle in it. A
# new kernel means the stamped module is refused, which means no oxp interfaces, which means no
# WAN, which means this script cannot reach codeload to fetch anything. The twelve ports that
# need the module are also the only way to the internet that would rebuild it.
#
# So the version can be given instead of read. After the update has installed the new kernel and
# BEFORE the reboot, the new kernel is already on disk and says what it is:
#
#     strings -a /boot/kernel/kernel | grep -m1 "^FreeBSD 1.*stable/"
#
# Pass that to this script while the old WAN is still alive, build against it, install the module
# with the new stamp, and then reboot once. Everything comes up together.
#
#     sh fetch-sources.sh "FreeBSD 15.1-RELEASE-p1 stable/26.7-n283674-12334a596709 SMP"

# The version to pin to: the first argument if one is given, otherwise the running kernel.
