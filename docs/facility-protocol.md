# The facility protocol

What the coprocessor publishes into its BARs, what it waits for, and what it offers once the
wait is over.

Every constant in the facility sections is from Marvell's GPL-2.0-only `pcie_ep_armada` driver -
`barmap.h`, `facility_conf.h`, `facility_host.c` - published by Sophos in its SFOS_OSS source ISO,
which is a free download. No vendor code is reproduced in this repository. The layout was first
recovered by disassembling the shipped binary module and later confirmed against the source; the
two agreed exactly, which is a reasonable check that these are the right structures.

## The BAR map

```
BAR0 - 1 MB window, 0x14000 used
  +0x00000   GIU          16 KB      (the MSI-X table sits at +0x1000)
  +0x04000   NW AGENT     64 KB

BAR2 - 16 MB, and the facilities are at the TOP of it, not the bottom
  window = BAR2 size - 0x104000
  window +0x000000   ctrl_map        4 KB
  window +0x001000   mgmt netdev     4 KB
  window +0x002000   RPC             1 MB
  window +0x102000   npu_bar_map     4 KB
  window +0x103000   PCI BOOTCMD     4 KB
```

The trailing 4 KB the window does not cover is the bootloader command page.

On a board with a 16 MB BAR2 the window starts at BAR2 + `0xEFC000`, so `npu_bar_map` is at
BAR2 + `0xFFE000` and `ctrl_map` at BAR2 + `0xEFC000`.

## npu_bar_map

```c
struct npu_bar_map {
        uint32_t version;                    /* must be 5 */
        uint32_t cookie;                     /* 0xD0FAC10D when published */
        struct facility_bar_map map[5];      /* 16 bytes each */
};

struct facility_bar_map {
        uint32_t bar;      /* 0 = BAR0, 1 = BAR2 */
        uint32_t type;
        uint32_t offset;   /* within the facility window */
        uint32_t size;
};
```

Poll the cookie, and then go on polling for the facility entries you actually need, because the
table is not published atomically. The cookie lands first, and an entry the coprocessor has not
written yet reads as all zeros - zero being the control facility's own id, so a half-published
table looks like a real one. Measured at about fourteen seconds after a reset pulse, twice over.

Until the coprocessor publishes the cookie the whole area reads as ones. Do not use that reading
to ask whether the coprocessor is alive: ask config space instead, never a BAR. A configuration
read to a device that is not answering comes back as all-ones rather than being left outstanding,
so `pci_read_config(dev, PCIR_VENDOR, 2) == 0xFFFF` says the endpoint is held in reset or its link
is down, and the driver returns instead of hanging. A memory read to an endpoint in reset neither
returns nor times out: no panic, no log, the machine simply stops.

The facility types, in enum order, which is **not** the order the entries appear in the map:

| value | name | t2h doorbells |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 0 | `ctrl` | 0 |
| 1 | `mvmgmt` | **1** |
| 2 | `nwa` | 0 |
| 3 | `rpc` | 0 |
| 4 | `giu` | **4** |

`mvmgmt`'s count is 1 even though its IRQ-count macro is 0. The vendor source carries the
comment *"Workaround for MSI NMP zero MSIX ID entry issue"* next to it. Keep it: the vector
numbering is a flat index across facilities in this order, so dropping it shifts every later
vector and the coprocessor asks for one nobody allocated.

Read the map from the device rather than using these as compile-time constants. The coprocessor
is what publishes it, and an implementation that assumed would write into the middle of
something else if a later firmware moved a facility.

## The control facility and the handshake

At the `ctrl` facility's offset:

```c
struct ctrl_map {
        uint32_t cookie;        /* 0xAFACAFAC */
        uint32_t handshake;
        uint32_t h2t_dbell_cnt;
        struct { uint64_t address; uint32_t data; } h2t_dbell_msg[];
};
```

```
bit 0   TRGT_INIT         target init done       - the coprocessor sets it
bit 1   HOST_INIT         host init done         - the host sets it
bit 2   TRGT_H2T_DBELL    target doorbells ready - the coprocessor sets it
bit 3   HOST_ALIVE        host alive             - the host sets it, repeatedly
```

The coprocessor's startup script polls this word through sysfs and blocks until all three of
`TRGT_INIT | HOST_INIT | HOST_ALIVE` are set. That is a mask test, `(handshake & 0x0b) == 0x0b`,
and not a numeric comparison: `0x0c` is the larger number and has neither `TRGT_INIT` nor
`HOST_INIT` in it. Bit 2 is not part of the condition.

Sequence, host side:

```
  check cookie == 0xAFACAFAC          refuse to write anything if it is not
  wait for bit 0
  allocate MSI-X vectors, install handlers        <- before, not after
  set bit 1
  set bit 3, and keep setting it
```

**Bit 3 is a heartbeat, not a flag.** The target clears it every time it looks, so a host that
sets it once and stops is a host the facility decides has gone away. The GIU datapath has a
keep-alive of its own - `NC_PF_KEEP_ALIVE` on the notification ring, and `mv_giu_drv`'s
`feature_enable` bit 0 - and that is a different mechanism from this bit.

## Doorbells

Five target-to-host doorbells: one for `mvmgmt`, four for `giu`, numbered as a flat index in
facility order, so `mvmgmt` is vector 0 and `giu` is 1 through 4.

The host does **not** write MSI-X messages into the shared memory. It allocates MSI-X vectors
the ordinary way; the MSI-X table lives in BAR0 at `+0x1000`, which is inside the GIU facility's
own window, and the operating system fills it as part of allocating the vectors. The
coprocessor then reads its own table to learn where to write.

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

- Mapping BAR0 as a driver resource is **required**, not a conflict with MSI-X allocation. The
  table is in it.
- The coprocessor raises a doorbell by **writing the MSI message itself**, outbound. So freeing
  the vectors does not stop it - its writes simply land on whatever takes their place. A driver
  unloading has to withdraw from the handshake first, and even that is not airtight because
  there is no acknowledgement to wait for. A reset pulse is the only certain answer.

## The GIU datapath, as far as it had been read

**Implemented, and this section is kept as it was first written.** It is what the disassembly said
before the vendor's GPL header and the running hardware corrected it, and three of its guesses
turned out wrong in ways worth leaving visible. [giu.md](giu.md) is the specification that was
actually built against and [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) has the current state; where this page
disagrees with either of them, that is chronology rather than contradiction - this page is the
older reading.

**Not one netdev but fourteen**, npup1..npup14, one per front port. The coprocessor does
multiplex them onto a single pair of queues, which is where the "one netdev" reading came from,
but what separates them is a tag rather than an interface - see "The ports" below.

Up to 16 Rx and 16 Tx queues. A control block in
the BAR whose first byte is a status word - bit 0 target ready, bit 1 host has configured the
queues, bit 2 target acknowledged - and the interface MAC published at control block + 4.

Two rings of **256 descriptors of 64 bytes**, command and notification, DMA-coherent in host
memory, with their physical addresses and index-register offsets written into eight fields at
`+0x10` through `+0x38` of the control block.

A descriptor is an 8-byte header and 56 bytes of payload; longer messages split across
descriptors with first/middle/last bits. Requests carry a 16-bit index, never 0 and never
`0xFFFF`, which the coprocessor echoes in the notification ring so a response can be matched to
its caller. `0xFFFF` is reserved for coprocessor-initiated events such as link up and down.

Sixteen management opcodes. Named here by what each calling function does, because the enum
labels are not in the binary - **and this table has since been superseded**. Marvell's GPL drop
carries `giu_nic_hw.h` with the real enum, transcribed into `contrib/npuep/npugiu.h`, and it
disagrees with three rows below: `0x05` is `CC_PF_INGRESS_TC_ADD` and `0x09` is
`CC_PF_MGMT_ECHO` - an echo, not a queue configuration - so the "in that call order" note is
wrong. The lesson is worth more than the table: a function's behaviour read from a disassembly
names what it does, not what it is called, and the two are not the same thing. Look in the GPL
drop before inferring an ABI.

| code | function |
|------|----------|
| `0x01`, `0x05`, `0x09` | configure queues, in that call order |
| `0x07` | enable |
| `0x0d` | set MAC address |
| `0x0e`, `0x0f` | Rx promiscuous, Rx multicast promiscuous |
| `0x10` | change MTU |
| `0x11` | Tx port loopback |
| `0x12`, `0x13` | add and remove VLAN |
| `0x16`, `0x18` | add MAC address, add Rx multicast address |
| `0x1c`, `0x1d` | port and queue rate limit |
| `0x1e` | get hardware capabilities |

Every command was thought to use a 48-byte request and a 105-byte response except `0x09` and
`0x1e`. **Also wrong**: request lengths are per command. The bring-up sends 0x10 for `PF_INIT`,
0x10 for `INGRESS_TC_ADD`, 0x30 for `INGRESS_DATA_Q_ADD`, 0x0c for `EGRESS_TC_ADD` and 0x20 for
`EGRESS_DATA_Q_ADD`. Responses do share one union, and every one of them spans two descriptors -
see [giu.md](giu.md).

A minimum viable set for link and traffic: `0x1e`, then `0x09`/`0x01`/`0x05`, then `0x0d`,
`0x10`, `0x07`.

The coprocessor's end of this is **not** vendor-proprietary. It is Marvell's open-source MUSDK
network management proxy, started from a shell script in the coprocessor's own firmware, so the
protocol is specified in readable C rather than only in one disassembly.

## The ports

**This was wrong, and it was the most consequential wrong thing in these notes.** The reading
said the fourteen front ports arrive on one trunk separated by **VLAN 4095** subinterfaces. They
are not separated by VLAN at all.

The coprocessor prepends **sixty-six bytes** to every frame in both directions: two bytes of port
identifier in network order, then sixty-four bytes of metadata. The driver writes that tag on
transmit to choose the egress port and reads it on receive to decide which interface a frame
belongs to. There is no VLAN header and no subinterface anywhere in it.

Nor is there one formula for the identifier. Ten ports sit behind an internal switch and carry
`0x8000 + n*0x100` for n = 1..10 - `0x8000` itself is the switch's uplink, not a front port; four
are separate MACs on the SoC and carry `0x0001`..`0x0004`. A host that assumes the first family
alone cannot address the other four at all - which is exactly what kept Port9 to Port12 dark until
the two families were separated.

Kept here rather than deleted because the VLAN reading was plausible, held for weeks, and is the
sort of thing another person working from the same binaries would conclude.
