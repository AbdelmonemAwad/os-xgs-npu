# The hardware

Measured on a Sophos XGS 136. Where a fact is known to generalise across the range it says so;
where it is not, assume it does not.

## What FreeBSD sees on the host

Working with no driver work at all:

```
CPU    AMD Ryzen Embedded R1606G, 4 CPUs (1 package x 2 cores x 2 threads)
RAM    8192 MB
Disk   ahci0 -> ada0, SATA 3.x
USB    xhci0, USB 3.0
SMBus  intsmb0 -> smbus0 (AMD FCH)      the I2C path to the SFP cages and the PoE controller
HID    Microchip MCP2210 USB to SPI Master -> usbhid0 -> hidbus0
serial uart0 0x3f8 (console) and uart2 0x3e8 (the NPU's console, needs a hint)
```

Not working, and it is the whole reason this repository exists:

```
pci1: <network, ethernet> at device 0.0 (no driver attached)
```

There is also no `superio`, so the NCT6779D hardware monitor - which the BIOS reads perfectly
well - is invisible to a stock FreeBSD. That is a separate piece of work.

## The endpoint

```
pci0:1:0:0   vendor=0x11ab device=0x7080   class=network/ethernet
  bar[10]  1 MB    64-bit
  bar[18]  16 MB   64-bit
  bar[20]  16 MB   32-bit
  PCIe     x4 @ 8.0 GT/s (Gen3)
  MSI      32 messages;  MSI-X 16 messages, table in BAR0 @0x1000, PBA @0x1800
  SR-IOV   VF device ID 0x7081, 6 VFs supported
  ARI, AER, LTR, TPH Requester, Resizable BAR, L1 PM Substates
```

The link is Gen3 x4, about 32 Gbit/s. All fourteen front ports together are about 17 Gbit/s at
most - eight switch ports and labels 9 and 10 at 1G, labels 11 and 12 at 2.5G, and the two SFP
cages at 1G - so the roughly 936 Mbps single-port ceiling reported by other projects on this
hardware is **not** a PCIe bandwidth limit, and neither is an MTU of 1500. Whatever causes them is
above the bus.

The SR-IOV capability reports 6 VFs where the vendor's Linux exposes 8 in sysfs. Unresolved, and
recorded because it is the sort of discrepancy that wastes a day later.

## Identifying the board from software

Two independent sources, and the second is the more useful one.

**SMBIOS** is awkward. `smbios.planar.product` is the generic string `XGS` across the whole
range and `smbios.planar.version` is not the model either. The assembly number is buried inside
`smbios.planar.serial`, in the form:

```
NEAAMDA0201-00xxxxxxxxxx
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   AMDA0201-0003 = Desktop XGS 136
```

So anything keying a chassis table off SMBIOS has to match on the serial, not on product or
version - and the serial also carries the unit's own identity, which is worth remembering before
putting it in a log.

**The MCP2210's EEPROM** is better for this purpose. Bytes 0 and 1 hold the assembly number as
`(byte0 << 8) | byte1`, so `0x00, 0xC9` is 201, which is AMDA0201. It is on the host side, needs
no I2C, and answers while the coprocessor is held in reset.

## The coprocessor

```
SoC       Marvell CN9131  (AP807 + two CP115)
storage   its own eMMC, 7.28 GiB, four partitions, root on p3
firmware  U-Boot 2019.10-10.22.03, Linux 4.14.207-10.22.03
model     the kernel reports "Sophos XGS126/136" - one board for both
cmdline   console=ttyS0,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p3 cpuidle.off=1
          isolcpus=1-3 nohz_full=1-3 rcu_nocbs=1-3
```

The CN9131's second CP115 is what lets this board drive fourteen ports where the nine-port model
in the same family uses a CN9130.

Three cores are isolated from the scheduler and run the dataplane; that is what `isolcpus=1-3`
is for.

The coprocessor boots from **its own storage**, not from the host's disk. Replacing the host SSD
- which is what running OPNsense on one of these means - does not touch its firmware at all,
and that is what makes the whole exercise reversible.

## The port map

Fourteen ports, all behind the coprocessor. The switch is an 88E6193X LinkStreet; the multi-gig
ports are on an AQR412C quad PHY.

```
labels 1-8   ->  switch ports 1-8      (88E6193X, CPU port is port 0)
label 9      ->  CN9131 COMPHY 2       (AQR412C address 0, 1G)
label 10     ->  CN9131 COMPHY 4       (AQR412C address 1, 1G)
label 11     ->  CN9131 COMPHY 5       (AQR412C address 2, 2.5G + PoE)
label 12     ->  CN9131 COMPHY 3       (AQR412C address 3, 2.5G + PoE)
F1, F2       ->  switch ports 9, 10    (SFP)
```

Each port takes one offset from the board's base MAC, in that order.

The device tree is **not** where this map lives, which is worth knowing before going looking for
it there. Neither the 9130 nor the 9131 device tree contains a switch node, a DSA node, an
AQR412C node or any PHY child: both MDIO controllers per CP are declared empty and handed to
userspace. The map comes from a platform text file in the coprocessor's firmware plus the
bootloader environment.

## What the vendor's own tools tell you

Useful mostly as a map of what is reachable and from where. Roughly half of the `xgs-*` tools on
the host are seven-line shell wrappers that ssh to the coprocessor over the management link -
which this repository's driver now brings up, so what limits them is the SFOS userland they expect
on the far side, not the link. The rest run on the host.

Two are worth naming:

- The USB-SPI flash tool is the one this repository's reset path is derived from. It also reads
  and writes the coprocessor's boot flash from the host, which means a bricked bootloader is
  recoverable without opening the case.
- The platform-init tool is **not** a bring-up tool despite the name. It probes I2C busses 0-7 at
  address `0x57` for the baseboard VPD EEPROM and builds a key-value database that everything
  else reads. FreeBSD has `smbus0` on this board, so that database can be rebuilt natively - it
  is where the per-port MAC addresses, PHY labels and transceiver configuration come from.
