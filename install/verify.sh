# Check, on the appliance, that the whole chain still works.
#
# Run this after every OPNsense or FreeBSD update, and after anything that touches the boot path.
# It is the answer to the one question CI cannot ask: a GitHub runner has no Sophos appliance, no
# USB-SPI bridge and no coprocessor, so a green tick upstream says nothing about whether this
# machine still has fourteen front ports.
#
# It changes NOTHING. Every check reads. It is safe on a running firewall and safe to run twice.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR: the kernel module is built against one kernel's headers. An update
# that moves FreeBSD forward leaves a module that will not load, and the appliance then boots to a
# firewall with no front ports and no obvious reason why - the hook exits 0 by design, because a
# firewall that boots late is better than one that does not boot. So the silence is deliberate,
# and this is what breaks it.
#
#   sh /usr/local/opnsense/scripts/npuctl/verify.sh
#   sh install/verify.sh            (from a checkout)
#
# Exit 0 if everything a firewall needs is true, 1 otherwise.

# not. There is no dry run; -n means "do not load if it is already loaded", and this branch only
# runs when it is not. So the check LOADED the module. On a firewall, from a script whose own
# header promises that it changes nothing. And when that load succeeded, every check after it
# passed - so a boot that had failed was reported as a healthy chain, which is the one
# circumstance this file exists to catch.
#

# __FreeBSD_version it was built against to the end of that branch, so a module built for 15.1
# loads cleanly into any later 15.x kernel rather than being refused. The mismatch has to be
